# Development Log

## 2024-12-22
### Initial Setup
- Created workspace structure
- Set up crate hierarchy
- Created README and documentation
- Initialized git repository

### BigInt Implementation Phase 1: Foundation
- Created basic BigInt struct with documentation
- Implemented core functionality:
  - new() for zero initialization
  - from_i32() for integer conversion
  - normalize() for internal representation
  - is_zero() for zero checking
  - abs() for absolute value

### BigInt Implementation Phase 2: Basic Arithmetic (Addition)
- Implemented addition operations:
  - add_absolute() for unsigned addition
  - Addition trait (Add, AddAssign) implementation
  - Support for both owned and referenced addition
- Implemented sign handling:
  - negate() for sign negation
  - Negation trait (Neg) implementation
- Added comparison functionality:
  - compare_abs() for absolute value comparison

### BigInt Implementation Phase 3: Comparison & Display
- Implemented Display trait with proper formatting
- Added specialized string representations:
  - Hexadecimal (to_hex())
  - Binary (to_binary())
- Implemented comparison traits:
  - PartialOrd for partial ordering
  - Ord for total ordering
  - Helper comparison methods (less_than, greater_than, etc.)
